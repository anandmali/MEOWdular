# A playground - MEOWdular cat adoption android practice app.

> A modular MVVM practice project with login flow and dashboard UI. APIs are mocked with local response at the API services layer to keep the architecture clean and more as an actual project.

## Architecture - MVVM

Modularized code providing benefits of better [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Demonstrating [recommended app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide#recommended-app-arch) with structuring into separate modules, that can be grouped as `activity/fragment`, `view models`, `repositories`, `data source`, and `dependecies`.

## Built with ðŸ›

    * [Data binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically
